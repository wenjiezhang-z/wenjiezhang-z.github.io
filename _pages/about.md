# 👤 About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at the Visual Sensing and Intelligent Systems Laboratory (VSISLab), Shandong University, China, with a focus on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I am advised by Prof. Wei Zhang, and I also work closely with my co-supervisors Prof. Ran Song and Prof. Xiao Jia. Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Shandong University.

**Research Interests:** I am broadly interested in the field of computer vision and deep learning. Particularly, I have mostly focused on visual scene understanding from images and videos. I have worked in image understanding tasks (Object Detection, Semantic Segmentation, Object Tracking), video understanding tasks (Exo-Centric Videos, Ego-Centric Videos, Human Activity Detection), and vision-language modeling. I am also very interested in medical image analysis and have worked on medical image segmentation tasks and medical surgical scene understanding tasks, among others.

**Collaboration:** I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Please feel free to reach out via email if you're interested.
